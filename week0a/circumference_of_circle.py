# Expected output
# Student should look at the following comments and compare to printed output.

# 50.24
# The circumference of a circle is 2πr where r is the radius of the circle.
# Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the circumference in inches of a
# circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π=3.14.

pi = 3.14
radius = 8
c  = (2 * pi) * radius
print c
