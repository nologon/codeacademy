# The area of a circle is πr2 where r is the radius of the circle. (The raised 2 in the formula is an exponent.)
# Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a circle
# whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π=3.14.
# Compute the area of a circle, given the length of its radius.

# Expected output
# Student should look at the following comments and compare to printed output.

#200.96
# area = pi * r ** 2
pi = 3.14
radius = 8
area = pi * (radius ** 2)
print "The area of the circle is %s" % area
